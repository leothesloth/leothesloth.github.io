<h2>Skills</h2>
	<p>I'm somewhat good at gaming. I can quickscope on Call of Duty Black Ops II. Quickscoping is using a sniper but not looking through the scope all the way. I sometimes miss but when I don't I feel proud of myself.</p>

<h2>High School</h2>
	<p>I would like to go to Browning Highschool because of their culinary program they have.</p>
	
<h2>College</h2>
	<p>I would like to go to a culinary school to learn more about being a professional chef that pays well.</p>
	
<h2>Career Interests</h2>
	<p>I would like to be a profesional chef and travel around the world to show others cooking skills and someday inspire them.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>I would like to be one of the best chef's in the world and start my own tv show.</p>
